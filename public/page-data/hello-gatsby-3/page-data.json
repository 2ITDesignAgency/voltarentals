Or maybe you’re a surfer hoping to hit some waves at the beaches around Peniche? Whatever your poison, make road tripping around Portugal that little bit easier by swotting up on the country’s toll road system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From where these roads are to how exactly you pay for them, here’s our simple guide on everything you need to know about Portugal’s toll routes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>First things first, where are Portugal’s toll roads?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re set on a driving holiday around Portugal, you’re in for a treat as its amazing cities and gorgeous countryside are all easy to access via a network of well-maintained roads. A good chunk of these are toll roads (known in the local lingo as Autoestradas), a system which you’ll likely have come across in both the UK and other European nations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind toll roads is that you pay to use a section of a motorway, with the money raised going to the local government to help pay for its upkeep. Portugal’s toll roads are a little more confusing than most due to the fact they’re largely electronic. There are numerous toll roads crisscrossing the country, however the major ones include:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– A1 between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europcar.com/en/car-rental/locations/portugal/lisbon\">Lisbon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europcar.com/en/car-rental/locations/portugal/porto\">Porto</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>– A28 between Porto and Valença</p>\n\n\n\n<p>– A22 between&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europcar.com/en/car-rental/locations/portugal/faro\">Faro</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europcar.com/en/car-rental/locations/portugal/portimao\">Portimao</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>– A2 between Lisbon and Algarve</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What’s an electronic toll road?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried about fumbling for change when you reach the toll gate? Scared of the honking of horns from the cars behind? You’re in luck. Unlike some toll roads where you’ll come across booths every so often where you can pay for using the route, electronic toll roads allow you to pay for how far you’ve driven after you’ve completed your journey. Phew.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How much will I have to shell out to use them?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>This depends on the vehicle you’re driving and how far you’re going. Basically, the longer you drive on a toll road for, the more expensive it will be. So, as a guide, if you take the A2 toll road from the Algarve to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europcar.com/en/car-rental/locations/portugal/lisbon\">Lisbon</a>, you’ll pay just under €20 in tolls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How do I pay for toll charges in Portugal?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Still worried about scrambling around to find the right money while a queue of cars builds behind you? We hear you. Ok, so on roads that haven’t yet gone electronic, you’ll find booths where you can pay using a credit/debit card. It’s quick and easy. Just remember that not all booths will accept non-Portuguese bank cards, so you might need some change to hand. Don’t worry, you’ll be fine!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the updated toll roads, there are no toll booths. What they’ve got instead is sensors set up at regular intervals along the roads. These record when you enter and exit a toll route. How you pay the fee depends on if you’re driving:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.europcar.com/editorial/europcar-content/uploads/2020/06/portugals-toll-roads-shutterstock_295509989.jpg\" alt=\"Portugal's Toll Roads\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A car registered in Portugal</strong>&nbsp;– Tolls can be paid in person at a local post office or at a registered Payshop. You won’t be able to pay for them until 48 hours have passed, and you’ll then have just five days to pay. Just don’t forget.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand you can ask for your hire care to come fitted with a transponder (sounds cool doesn’t it?). What this little bit of tech does is mean you can preload this with credit and automatically record your toll road usage. This is then deducted from your credit allowance. It also means you can use the special ‘Via Verde’ lanes at any toll stations you might come across during your travels.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A car registered in another country</strong>&nbsp;– On an epic European road trip? Hired your car from another country? No worries, you still have a few options when it comes to toll payments. One of the easiest is to buy a Toll Card from a local post office, tourism office, service station or an Easy Toll Welcome Point. You’ll add pre-paid credit to it and then activate it over text message. Simple!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How do I check if my payment has worked?</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Worried about what you’ve spent?

We get you. Luckily, for every toll road in Portugal, there’s usually another route you can use that’ll be completely free of charge. Be warned though: the toll-free roads are not as well-maintained and are usually longer routes.
