Keep your eyes peeled for trams</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We love Melbourne. It’s artsy, a haven for foodies and blessed with some truly lush beaches – basically Melbourne is an absolute corker of a city! But there’s one thing you really need to look out for. Yes we’re talking trams!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Melbourne’s tram system is pretty extensive and runs right alongside the roads, often cutting across them. Just make sure you’re aware of the tracks (and any locomotives that might be hurtling towards you!) and that you never drive on a tramline that’s got solid yellow lines either side of it. Also look out for tracks with dotted yellow lines – these mean you’re allowed to drive on them when there’s no trams coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Clue yourself up on the drink driving rules</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hoping to deal with the intense Aussie summer heat by cracking open a cold one? That’s local lingo for beer! Well, remember you can only have 0.05% alcohol in your blood. That’s about the equivalent of two small beers if you’re an average sized man and one-to-two small drinks if you’re a woman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Stick to the speed limits</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Australian traffic cops won’t hesitate to issue you with a speeding ticket (even if you claim ignorance as a clueless visitor…) To make sure your bank balance doesn’t take a huge hit, stick to the speed limits, especially on motorways where there’s normally some sneaky speed cameras waiting to catch you out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s always handy to take note of the standard speed limits before you travel. They are:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>– Cities and built up areas</strong>&nbsp;– 50km/h</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>– Motorways&nbsp;</strong>– 100km/h</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>– School zones</strong>&nbsp;– 25km/h</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speed limits can also vary in different states and cities, so pay attention when you’re driving and keep an eye out for traffic signs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aussie Outback driving tips</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready for a real intrepid Aussie adventure? The Australian Outback is the place to be. But it is the wilderness, which means it comes with its own set of road rules. You’ll want to:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Check your rental car is roadworthy</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all cars will be able to hack the intense heat and rougher roads of the Outback. When you’re choosing your rental car, make sure you make us aware of your plans so we can help you find the best possible vehicle for the job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Fuel up whenever you can</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While you’ll spot plenty of places to refuel in the cities and towns, Australia’s rural regions are a little thin on the ground. You could drive for hours without seeing another vehicle or person, let alone a petrol station!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To avoid breaking down in the back of beyond, check the map for possible fuel stops before you begin any journey into the Aussie countryside – no matter whether it’s an inter-city route like the Great Ocean Road or a trip into the bush. Remember to refuel before you set off and NEVER let your petrol gauge go into the red.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Always take supplies (just in case)</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you’re travelling somewhere that’s as barren and vast as the outback, it’s worth being a little cautious. Don’t assume that breaking down will never happen to you. It could and this really isn’t the place to break down without supplies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s super important to make sure you stock your car with plenty of fresh water and some food, plus extra fuel in case you run out in between service stations. Longer trips might make a satellite phone a good idea – the outback is notorious for its bad cellphone signal!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://www.europcar.com/editorial/europcar-content/uploads/2020/11/rules-of-the-road-australia-dreamstime_xl_159625360.jpg\" alt=\"Rules Of The Road Australia Dreamstime Xl 159625360\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4.Don’t ignore those wildlife warning signs</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thought that sign of a koala was cute? It’s not just there for your amusement (or as a great photo op for your Instagram). It actually means there’s wild koalas in the area and that you should keep your speed in check to avoid hitting any that might be hanging out in the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll spot various wildlife warning signs across Australia and you should always take them seriously – the last thing you want is a kangaroo-shaped dent on the side of your rental car!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Aussie driving essentials:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make sure your Aussie driving adventure goes without a hitch, always make sure you’ve got:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. A valid international driver’s license (a UK one is fine, too) – you’ll need to apply for a local license if you’re staying for longer than three months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Good car insurance (and extra cover if you’re travelling in the outback).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3.
