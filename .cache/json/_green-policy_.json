Then Europcar matches your donation, so that together we plant two trees in the Burkina Faso desert.&nbsp;The project we have chosen to support with WeForest aims to protect the highly vulnerable region of the Burkina Faso Sahel from further degradation and impacts of climate change, &nbsp;by reforesting 15 million hectares along a 15 km-wide, 7,775 km-long belt, from Dakar to Djibouti. This area is &nbsp;part of the Great Green Wall (Grande Muraille Verte). The project has been developed by the African Union to fight desertification in South Sahara.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Go for Green with Europcar!</strong>At Europcar, we are committed to offering our customers the newest range of vehicles which benefit from the latest innovations in terms of green technology (reduced CO2 emissions, hybrid, electric&#8230;)&nbsp;The Europcar fleet produces much lower emmissions that the European average since our passenger vehicles are extremely &nbsp;new (average age of 4,7 months) and CO2 emissions are at the low level of 125.2g/km&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=\"http://www.europcar.com/files/live/sites/Europcar/files/contributed/Europcar.com/Concierge/Green_Policy/95x90_looking_at_cloudscape.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Europcar and Sustainable Development</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Environmental respect has always been a key objective for Europcar International.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, we have developed the Green Charter with our main partners.
